# Owen-Wilson-Wow-Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that uses the Owen Wilson API to reply to messages with a random video. 

## Description

I saw the [Owen Wilson API](https://owen-wilson-wow-api.herokuapp.com/) on reddit today and thought it'd be fun to play around with. I'd also been wanting to test making a Discord bot, so I put two and two together to come up with this. 

The bot will respond to any message containing 'wow' with a random video of Owen Wilson saying "Wow". 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* It should only need requests and discord.py
